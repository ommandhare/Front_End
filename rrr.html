            <p>"Performances : 
                NTR and Ram Charan have competed with each 
                other in giving the best performances to date.
                Their meeting, confrontational scenes together are completely new and exciting for the audience. It is needless to say how Rajamouli makes his actors look well built, but the emotions and the body language
                are so well given by the actors.</p>
